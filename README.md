# DeepGenius 🚀

## Description

Welcome to DeepGenius! This cutting-edge project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to generate hyper-realistic fake images. The model is trained on a vast dataset of real images, enabling it to produce highly convincing fake images that are virtually indistinguishable from reality. 😎🖼️

## Installation

To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git` 📥
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd DeepGenius` 📂
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` ⚙️
4. Download the pre-trained model weights: [link to the model weights] 📦
5. Place the model weights in the `models` directory. 🗂️
6. Run the project: `python main.py` 🚀

## Usage

Once the project is installed and running, you can generate fake images by providing input images to the model. The generated fake images will be saved in the `output` directory. 🖼️🔥
